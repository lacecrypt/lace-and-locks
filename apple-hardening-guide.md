Firstly, I'd like to preface this by saying that
no phone is 100% private or secure. Hardening is more about reducing
your attack surface, not achieving absolute anonymity. (This will be repeated on all of my phone hardening guides).

Out of the box, iOS is one of the stronger mainstream consumer mobile platforms. Apple builds strong sandboxing, encryption and app-review protections into the system. That matters and lowers your baseline risk.

That said, best out of the box does not equal perfect. If your threat model is serious (targeted surveillance, nation-level actors, or extreme privacy/anonymity goals), my top pick for going "as far as possible" is to switch to a pixel and run GrapheneOS. It's purpose-built to minimize attack surface and harden Android's kernel and permission model. If you want the absolute top privacy & security posture, that's the reccommendation.

Important behavioral note (shocking, but very true): Malwarebytes' analysis (July 24, 2025) found iPhone users more likely to behave riskily online (more promo-sharing, fewer using security tools, and a higher scam-victim rate). For example: 53% of iPhone users reported being a scam victim (vs 48% Android); only 21% of iPhone users said they use security software vs 29% of Android users. Read the article; it's worth a hard look at user behavior. Highly reccommend it.

This guide will overlap in places with my Android Hardening guide, since both deal with smartphones and share many of the same security practices. That said, there are also some important differences to note. I will go through all of those.

## I. Initial Setup

‚Äé‚ãÜ ÀöÔΩ°‚ãÜ Í™Ü‡ßé Àö  

* Firstly, Apple ID. Use the least personal info possible. Treat your Apple ID like it's a root account, create a unique, strong password, with 2-factor auth enabled. Apple's Stolen Device Protection and 2FA are important guardrails. Turn them on.
* Passcode > Pin. Set a long alphanumeric passphrase for device unlock if possible (or at least a long numeric code). PINS are convenient but short ones are brute-forcible.
* Biometrics. Albeit convenient and useful, proceed with caution. Biometrics are powerful evidence (legally) in some jurisdictions and can be bypassed in targeted attacks. Use them for everyday convenience, but keep a strong passphrase and consider temporarily disabling biometrics in high-risk settings (borders, protests, etc).
* Turn on automatic iOS updates. Many serious exploits are patched quickly; apply updates. Apple's platform docs show how much Apple relies on security patches & system protections.

---

## II. Apple Account, iCloud & Backups (big privacy tradeoffs)
* What you gain with iCloud: seamless encrypted backups, Find My, cross-device sync.
* What you trade: metadata and some content stored on Apple servers (even if encrypted). If total control is a priority to you, disable iCloud backups and sync, do encrypted, local backups to your own computer (Finder on macOS, iTunes on older macOS/Windows) and keep the backup password. You do compromise convenience by doing this.
* Compromise: Keep iCloud for Find My and device recovery, but turn off data types you don't want synced (Contacts/Photos/Health) and disable iCloud Keychain, use a strong Apple ID password + 2FA.
* Enable Stolen Device Protection. It adds friction for a thief trying to change your account or erase the device.

---

## III. Lock Screen, Notifications, Siri and Lock-screen Privacy

.ñ•î ›Å Àñ   ‚ú¶    ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö ‚ãÖ

* Disable lock screen access to sensitive things. Turn off Siri when locked, Wallet access, Control Center access from Lock Screen, Home controls on Lock Screen, and notification previews for sensitive apps ("When Unlocked" or off). Attackers with a moment of physical access can exploit these.
* Disable Reply From Lock Screen and Show Previews. Set notifications to "When Unlocked" so content is not visible at a glance.

---

## IV. App Store and Apps
* Unfortunately, your only option for downloading apps (safely) is the app store. iOS enforces a curated store (strong sandboxing), which reduces malware risk, this is an advantage. That said, store apps still request lots of permissions and can leak data. Be aggressive about which apps you install.
* Remove everything you don't use. If an app doesn't have a clear reason to exist, delete it. Fewer apps means fewer trackers, which means fewer background jobs, which means less risk.
* Prefer FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) where practical. Signal, Proton, Tutanota, Mullvad, Bitwarden, KeePass clients are all examples. FOSS provides auditable code (obviously not a panacea, but useful).
* Walled-garden tradeoff: iOS is safer from unknown sideloaded malware than stock Android, but that convenience comes at the cost of less control (no native system-level firewall or easy app-isolation like GrapheneOS offers).

---

## V. Permissions Hygiene
* Go to Settings ‚û≥ Privacy & Security ‚û≥ review Location, Microphone, Camera, Photos, Contacts, Tracking, Bluetooth.
* Location: "Never" or "While Using" for most apps. Toggle "Precise Location" off for apps that don't need it.
* Microphone & Camera: Deny unless in active use. Many apps ask but don't actually need them.
* Photos: use "Selected Photos" for apps that need to read images.
* Tracking: keep "Allow Apps to Request to Track" off when you want.
* Tracking Transparency (ATT): encouraged, but not all developers comply; still a good win where supported.
* Periodically open the list of apps that have recently used each permission, and revoke them ruthlessly.

---

## VI. Network Privacy

* VPN: Useful on untrusted Wi-Fi; pick a reliable, lo-logs provider you trust. I recommend Mullvad and NordVPN, Proton if you need a free option (or self-host Wireguard).
* Apple Private Relay: convenient security feature for Safari and certain traffic, but it's not a full VPN and doesn't protect non-Safari apps. Consider it for only casual privacy.
* Private DNS: Set a privacy-focused DNS (NextDNS, Quad9, or Mullvad DNS) to block malicious/telemetry domains at the DNS level. If you use a full VPN, check its DNS.
* Avoid auto-connecting to unknown Wi-Fi hotspots and turn off auto-join for networks you don't trust. Use "Ask to Join Networks" when in public.

---

## VII. Browser & Web Hardening
* Safari: good privacy defaults and Apple's ecosystem integrations. Use Safari with "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking," "Block All Cookies" for high privacy, and content blockers for ad-tracking.
* Better Alternate Browsers: Brave, Firefox Focus, or Onion Browser (for Tor) if you need specialized features or compartmentalized browsing. Remember that third-party browsers on iOS still use Apple's WebKit Engine; differences are UI and privacy features, not core rendering.
* Use a separate browser for risky/disposable browsing (shopping from unknown sites, one-time registrations) to contain tracking cookies and sessions.

.‚òòÔ∏é ›ÅÀñ

## VIII. Messaging & Calls
* Prefer end-to-end encrypted apps: iMessage and FaceTime between Apple users are E2E, but they're apple-to-apple only. Signal is the best cross-platform E2E choice for messaging, voice, and video. I recommend it for communications where you prioritize privacy.
* Avoid SMS for sensitive 2FA or secrets (SMS is interceptable and vulnerable to SIM swap). Use TOTP apps or hardware 2FA keys (YubiKey/FIDO) where supported.

---

## IX. Passwords & 2FA
* Password Manager: Use iCloud Keychain if you trust Apple and want seamless integration. If you prefer the alternatives (which I recommend): Bitwarden (cloud), or KeePass (local) are solid. Use strong, unique passwords for every single account. As I've mentioned the Malwarebytes article before, it shows how poor password hygiene is common. Fix that.
* Password audit: run the "Security Recommendations" in Settings ‚û≥ Passwords to find reused/weak passwords.

---

## X. SIM Security & Mobile Provider Hygiene

‚ãÜ. ùúóùúö Àö‚ãÜ

* PIN the SIM: set a SIM PIN so someone can't remove the SIM and abuse it.
* Call your carrier and ask about SIM swap protections and add extra verification where available (PIN, callback).
* If privacy matters, consider prepaid/minimal-info carriers for at-least-some anonymity; be mindful of your legal/local regulations.

---

## XI. Physical & Peripheral Attack Surface
* USB Restricted Mode/Allow USB Accessories: Make sure accessories aren't allowed while device is locked (this reduces cable-based forensic access). Apple has a setting for this; keep it restrictive.
* Avoid public charging "juice-jack" ports. Carry a power bank or a charge-only cable.
* Privacy screen & Camera Covers: Use a privacy screen protector in public (do be wary of these, I have heard they cause eye strain in some people, though I don't know this to be a fact), camera covers for extreme paranoia (physical tape or an integrated slider).
* AirDrop: set AirDrop to "Contacts Only" or "Receiving Off" in public places to avoid unsolicited files. This used to be a huge issue, but I think AirDrop is becoming less prevalent now.

---

## XII. Radior & Sensor

ìÇÉ ‡£™Àñ ÷¥÷∂÷∏‚ãÖ·°£ê≠© ‡ºã‡ºò‡øê

* Bluetooth/NFC/AirDrop: Turn off when not needed. Bluetooth tracking is used in stores/beacons and increases background attack surface.
* Location services: disable for unnecessary apps. Remember that even with GPS off, IP-level information narrows you down.

---

## XIII. Forensics & Stolen Device
* Find My: Useful for location and remote actions but increases cloud dependency. If you disable it, you lose remote erase. Balance this with your own threat model.
* Stolen Device Protection & Activation Lock: Keep them enabled, as they make stolen devices harder to reuse.

---

## XIV. App Sandboxing & Advanced Privacy Features
* Limit Background App Refresh and Background App Refresh for cellular if you don't want apps pinging servers in the background.
* Use per-app permissions for cellular data if you want to block data usage for specific apps (Settings ‚û≥ Cellular).
* Content blockers: use reputable content blockers in Safari (or other browsers) to reduce trackers and malicious ad content.

---

## XV. Anti-malware and Security Apps on iOS; What to Expect

* iOS' architecture limits what "antivirus" apps can do (no kernel access). Security apps for iOS mainly offer phishing protection, VPN/traffic filtering, scam alerts, and identity monitoring. They're not full AV scanners like on desktop. Don't rely on them as a replacement for good hygiene.

---

## XVI. Logging, Analytics & Telemetry
* Go to Settings ‚û≥ Privacy & Security ‚û≥ Analytics & Improvements and disable data sharing if you don't want telemetry going to Apple or third parties. Also check each app's analytics preferences.

---

## XVII. Forensics & Stolen Device
* Find My: Useful for location and remote actions but increases cloud dependency. If you disable it, you lose remote erase. Balance this with your own threat model.
* Stolen Device Protection & Activation Lock: Keep them enabled, as they make stolen devices harder to reuse.

---

## XVIII. Compartmentalization & Second Device Strategy
* Two-device Approach: Use one device for sensitive comms and banking (minimal apps, strict settings) and another for casual browsing/shopping/social. It's a heavier-weight strategy but extremely effective.
* Workspaces: Use separate user accounts on other platforms (laptops) and multi-profile mental discipline for accounts and authentication.

---

## XIX. Optional Advancements
* Air-gapped/burner device: Keep a dedicated, minimal device for extremely sensitive stuff. No cloud, only local backups.
* Hardware tokens (FIDO2): Use them for your most important accounts (Google, Apple ID, major emails).
* Faraday bag during travel for short windows to remove remote access.
* Physical mic/camera removal or hardware mods; is possible but voids warranty and should be a last resort.

---

## XX. Don't jailbreak. Seriously.
* Jailbreaking removes critical sandboxing and verified-boot protections and massively increases risk. The theoretical control gains are almost always outweighed by real world risk for most people.

---

## XXI. Maintain Good Habits
* Do weekly or biweekly sweeps. Review your app list, permissions, pending updates, and password manager alerts.
* Threat model. Review who you're protecting against and update practices accordingly. If you don't know how to threat-model, start by asking "who wants my data?" and "what would they target?" and tune to your own preferences.

---

## XXII. Why you Should Consider Switching to Pixel + GrapheneOS
* If your threat model requires minimizing vendor telemetry, stricter sandboxing, and kernel-level hardening with explicit design for security researchers and privacy advocates, GrapheneOS on a Pixel reduces many platform-level attack vendors; it is the standard for the "most hardened phone" path. However, it is not for casual users. You trade convenience and some app compatibility for control and significantly lower attack surface.

Hardening your iOS device isn't just a one-and-done
thing. It's a habit. Stay curious, you should be constantly reviewing
permissions, questioning every app you install, and staying updated.
Remember: convenience is always the enemy of security. Balance wisely. (Yes, this is the same message as I have on my Android Hardening Guide, it's good advice ok?)
